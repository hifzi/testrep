# testrep
testrep is a repository I created for learning purposes and to explore GitHub and its various features more thoroughly. This repository is not intended for real project development, but rather serves as a sandbox for practicing and understanding how Git works, including basic commands and key features such as branching, pull requests, issues, and more. Through experimenting with this repository, I aim to improve my technical understanding and become more confident in using GitHub for future projects.
